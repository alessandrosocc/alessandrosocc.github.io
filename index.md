## About Me

I am a second year Master’s student in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the University of Cagliari, where I also serve as a Research Assistant under Prof. Ludovico Boratto, Dr. Mirko Marras, and Dr. Giacomo Medda. My research focuses on Recommender Systems.

I have authored four research papers, including two published in top-tier international conferences (ACM CIKM ’25, ACM RecSys ’24), and have mentored one Bachelor’s student on his thesis project. I am also part of the Excellence Program, an honors track reserved for only two top-performing MSc students, and an **Lead the Future (LTF) Mentee**, a selective mentorship program for outstanding students with an acceptance rate of around 10% (over 2.5k applications). I’ve also been recognized by [**Forbes**](https://nextleaders.forbes.it/top-graduate/) as one of the top 100 graduate students in Italy (over 300 applications).


**[PhD]** I am actively seeking PhD positions in Europe in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.

## Research Interests

- **Recommender Systems:** Explainability, Knowledge Graphs, Semantic IDs
- **Natural Language Processing:** Architectures, Efficiency, Representation Learning
