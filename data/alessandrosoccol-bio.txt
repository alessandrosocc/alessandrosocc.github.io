I'm a Master Student in Applied Artificial Intelligence at University of Cagliar and a Research Assistant at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Ludovico Boratto, Prof. Mirko Marras and Dr. Giacomo Medda where I conduct research about Recommender Systems, Natural Language Processing and the intersection of those fields to create performant and Knowledge-aware Explainable Recommender Systems.
